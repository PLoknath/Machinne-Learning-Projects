# Project Title

The objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts laptop prices based on a diverse range of specifications and features. For consumers, an accurate pricing model can serve as a valuable guide whereas for manufacturers, such a model provides insights into competitive pricing strategies and market positioning based on the specifications offered.



## Objective

- Develop a model that can accurately predict laptop prices based on various features, helping the clients stay competitive in the market.

- Understand how different features contribute to pricing, enabling clients to strategically position its laptops in the market.
